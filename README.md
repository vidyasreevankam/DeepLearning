# DeepLearning with Pytorch
These files are based on the DeepLearning with Pytorch UdacityNanoDegree
These are started with singlelayer neural network, multilayer neural network.
They include Tensors in pytorch, neuralnetworks in pytorch, training neural networks,fashion mnist data inference and validation ,working with image data,transfer learning.
basic model of cnn,
basic model of rnn,
sentiment analysis,
wordembeddings using skipgram,
ganmnist.
